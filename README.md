To simulate and try ways to handle a stream of events

Instructions:
-------------
1) yarn install
2) yarn start

Incremental changes (past requirement changes):
-----------------------------------------------
1) able to handle a stream of events (keyboard presses)
2) able to handle various builds with different characters/commands
3) able to handle "work" that takes a long time (in this case, displaying the changed value of the character)
    -> to simulate a reason for async work
4) change Game to poll events from Main instead of Main pushing events to Game constantly
